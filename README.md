## hello!
I am a software development student in the Netherlands. Programming is my hobby and I like making things myself. I mainly focus around low-level development, but I'd like to think I go wherever I kinda want to go.<br/>
Feel free to look around!<br/>
I don't really expect people to use things I make. Since it is more niches of what I need, or just school projects. Please contact me if you do intend on using my code.
