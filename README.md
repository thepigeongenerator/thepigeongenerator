    My name is Quinn, programming is my hobby and passion, with my focus on low-level development.
    I'm still learning, and although I'm under the impression you'll never stop learning, I still find myself quite a way to go until I feel contempt with what I've learnt.
</p>

## what I'm working on
<p>
    Where currently I am working on mastering C, which seems to include learning and understanding assembly.
    I then plan to learn C++ to a level I'm comfortable working in it. And lastly, Rust, where with the knowledge acquired with C++ will be easier.
    As a problem with Rust when I tried tackling it in the past, is it's unique syntax and concepts that are quite new to me.
    My goal of this is using C and Rust as my main languages of choice. Where each can shine in their own area. Where C++ comes in their own corner, but I don't see myself using it that much.
</p>

## OS
<p>
    My operating system of choice is Linux. Where there also is a strong preference towards POSIX-compliant & unix-like systems.
    The standardisation makes it really easy to write code which executes natively on platforms with minimal changes, which you wouldn't see with JIT-compiled languages.
    I dislike developing for Windows, as it tends to have a different ecosystem and standards.
    I am aware it's the OS most people use, but to me it still sticks out like a sore thumb. Where it's just... "different".
    But, I try my best when I write code not targeting a specific platform, to write it as platform-agnostic as I can.
    Where I try to keep architechture and OS in mind, reducing changes later down the line when adding support for those.
